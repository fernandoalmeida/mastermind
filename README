The game of Mastermind involves two players: the code-maker and the code-breaker. The job of the code-breaker is to deduce a secret code made up of four colors chosen by the code-maker. Six colors are possible to made the secret code: B=Black, C=Cyan, G=Green, R=Red, Y=Yellow, W=White.

The code-maker chooses a secret code. The code-breaker gets some number of chances (typically ten) to break the code. In each turn, the code-breaker takes a guess at the code, placing 4 colors. The code-maker then marks the guess with black and white.

The black marker indicates that one the colors in the guess is the right color and in the right position, but not reveal which one. A white marker indicates that one of the colors in the guess is of a color which is in the solution (again without revealing which one), but is in the wrong position. For example, if the score is 2 black and 1 white, then we know that the guess has three colors that are part of the code and two of them are actually in the right positions.
